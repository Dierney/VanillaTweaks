# VanillaTweaks
It's a tiny mod that doesn't add any content. Instead it tweaks some stuff from normal Terraria. Those tweaks include buffs (Obsidian and Gladiator armor), nerfs (Meteor Hamaxe), changes (Night's Edge autoswing) and fixes (Bone Blocks now drop Bones).

The full list of changes can be found on the **TCF Thread**: http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/vanilla-tweaks-a-mod-with-no-content.37443/

Download either from "[Releases](https://github.com/goldenapple3/VanillaTweaks/releases)" on this website or from the Mod Browser. Latest version is compatible with tModLoader v0.7.1.1
