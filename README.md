# Vanilla Tweaks
It's a tiny mod that doesn't add any content. Instead it tweaks some stuff from normal Terraria. Those tweaks include buffs (Obsidian and Gladiator armor), nerfs (Meteor Hamaxe) and changes (Night's Edge autoswing).

The full list of changes can be found on the **TCF Thread**: http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/vanilla-tweaks-a-mod-with-no-content.37443/
